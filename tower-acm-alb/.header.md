# tower-acm-alb module

This module can be used to deploy a programmatic alb with ACM certificate. Pointing to a given ec2 instance, that will be running a tower installation.
Ideally, a tower installation inside the k3s cluster.

## Usage

The example below, will show how to create a public certificate, an external application load balancer, and configure one ec2 instance as a target for a target group, configuring the listener with the previously created certificate.

```hcl
## main.tf
module "tower-acm-alb" {
  source                        = "github.com/seqeralabs/terraform-modules//tower-acm-alb"
  record_name                   = "tower.example.com"
  alb_name                      = "tower-alb"
  domain_name                   = "example.com"
  instance_id                   = "i-01234abcd4321abc"
  public_subnets_id             = ["subnet-1234abc1234", "subnet-1234abc1234", "subnet-1234abc1234"]
  alb_delete_protection_enabled = false
  tags                          = {
    Terraform = "true"
    Application = "Tower"
  }
}
```
